# Person Things

- Name: redstone59
- Pronouns: she/her
- Languages: Python (fluent), C# (semi-fluent), C (practically a beginner)
- Learning: JavaScript, TypeScript
- Currently enjoying: C# and Unity, rewriting old projects
- Currently not enjoying: old projects (that was the *bad time* - when I didn't know how to style code nor what a class was)

# Current Projects

**Nine Cir*****le***: A -le game (like Wordle, Globle, etc.) based on the various clones of Nine Circles in Geometry Dash. Basically, my excuse to learn TypeScript and JavaScript.

**Backshot Roulette Rewrite**: A bot that finds the best move in any position in a game of Buckshot Roulette. Again. But I'm gonna do it LIVE!!! ON STREAM!!!

**NEStone59**: An NES emulator written from the ground up, written live on stream.

**Buckshot Game Notation**`*`: An adaptation of Chess' *algebraic notation* for Buckshot Roulette.

`*` Currently a private repo until it's functional. This is typically how I do things. sowwy

## Projects I'm considering

**Some kind of Buckshot Roulette all-in-one program**: A BGN editor with evaluation capabilities with a bot of choice (in this case, Backshot Roulette). I've already devised the Buckshot Bot Interface so the program can communicate with other bots, too. Maybe it'd be a mod onto Buckshot Roulette (I do use Godot on occasion, a mod surely couldn't be that hard)

**mCmd (working title)**: A higher level language for Minecraft command blocks. Currently considering redoing the whole program so then it's Pythonic instead of C-like. (there are too many C command block languages)
