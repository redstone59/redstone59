I'm redstone59, here's the things you need to know:

- Pronouns: she/her
- Languages: Python (fluent), C# (semi-fluent), C (practically a beginner)
- Learning: JavaScript, TypeScript
- Currently enjoying: Buckshot Roulette, rewriting old projects
- Currently not enjoying: old projects (that was the *bad time* - when I didn't know how to style code and classes)

# Current Projects

**Backshot Roulette**: A bot that finds the best move in any position in a game of Buckshot Roulette.

**Buckshot Game Notation**: An adaptation of Chess' *algebraic notation* for Buckshot Roulette.

## Projects I'm considering

**Bejeweled 3 World Championship Set Rewrite**: This was a real novel idea I had, but for god's sake the code looks awful. A "parasite" program that latches onto Bejeweled 3 in order to give a Nintendo World Championship style game (pointers in Python suck, btw)

**Some kind of Buckshot Roulette all-in-one program**: A BGN editor with evaluation capabilities with a bot of choice (in this case, Backshot Roulette). I've already devised the Buckshot Bot Interface so the program can communicate with other bots, too. Maybe it'd be a mod onto Buckshot Roulette (I do use Godot on occasion, a mod surely couldn't be that hard)

**mCmd (working title)**: A higher level language for Minecraft command blocks. Currently considering redoing the whole program so then it's Pythonic instead of C-like. (there are too many C command block languages)
